Attention ... I do not intend to be worthy of the work of others. This module was not created by me. I am just sharing because it seems that it is no longer available in the original place from which it was acquired.
When you use a CAD software to create a design, this design consists usually of two different types of components: Custom parts that are specific to your purposes and have to be custom made (e.g. by 3D printing), and standard parts like nuts and bolts that you can buy in a hardware store.  A standard parts library relieves you from the tedious task of modeling standard parts by providing them readily usable, so that you can focus on the interesting aspects of your design.
